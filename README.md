# To-Do App
ðŸ’» A project to reinforce and improve my JavaScript knowledge.

âœ… In this project, I used JavaScript to add and remove elements from a list, as well as to implement a feature that allows searching through the added elements.

âœ… I kept the code as simple as possible because I created this application to practice JavaScript.

ðŸ’– Design is the most enjoyable but also the most time-consuming part. To avoid spending too much time on this project, I used Bootstrap, which saved me a lot of time.
